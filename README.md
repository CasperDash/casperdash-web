## Folder

1. components: Reusable UI pieces that can be used throughout the app.
2. enums: Collection of constant variables, used to store values that won't change.
3. hooks: Custom hooks that allow code reuse by encapsulating stateful logic.
4. layouts: Components designed to provide shared layout elements across pages.
5. modules: Standalone pieces of functionality that handle specific parts of the app logic.
6. pages: Associated with a specific route and responsible for rendering their own UI and fetching data.
7. store: Contains Redux reducers, actions, and selectors that handle app state management.
8. typings: Typescript types used as reusable interfaces for commonly-used data shapes.
9. services: Provides communication between external data sources (e.g. API) and the app.
10. utils: Functions that contain useful logic and can be used across different parts of the app.
## Code convention
